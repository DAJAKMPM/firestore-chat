# Firestore Chat with React Native

This is a React Native + Firebase project with login, registration, persisted login, firestore reads and writes, and expo push notifications.

## Getting Started (with Expo)

If you are using Expo Cli, clone the repo and run "expo start" in the root folder of the project:

```
git clone https://github.com/apappas1129/firestore-chat.git
cd firestore-chat
expo start
```

## Getting Started (without Expo)

If you prefer using React Native CLI, you'll need to eject from Expo first:

```
git clone https://github.com/apappas1129/firestore-chat.git
cd firestore-chat
expo eject
npm install
react-native run-android // react-native run-ios
```
